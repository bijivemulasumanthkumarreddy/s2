# Emotion Detection using CNN

**Project done by Bijivemula Sumanth Kumar Reddy**

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the **HES (Human Emotions) Dataset**. The model is designed to predict human emotions based on facial expressions, making it suitable for real-time emotion recognition applications.

## Model Details:

- **Dataset**: [HES Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadhananasghar/human-emotions-datasethes)
- **Model Type**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Application**: Real-time emotion detection from facial expressions

The model has been optimized for performance and can be applied in various fields, including healthcare, security, and human-computer interaction, to enhance user experiences.
